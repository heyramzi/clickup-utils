# Changelog

## Technical History

- 2026-04-20: feat(cli): v0.6.0, view management. `views list --list <id>` shows custom views on a list, `view create (--list|--folder|--space) --name --type [--group-by|--filters-json|--grouping-json|--sorting-json|--columns-json|--settings-json]` creates a view, `view delete <viewId>` removes one. Minimal ergonomic shortcuts for common cases (`--group-by status`), JSON passthrough for advanced filters/grouping/sorting. Unlocks scripted dashboard-like list views. Driver: Seraph Immo needs 6 views on the Opérations list (ramzi).
- 2026-04-20: feat(cli): v0.5.0, write commands for workspace structure. `folder create/update/delete`, `list create/update/delete`, `fields list`, `task field set`. `task create` gains `--parent` (subtask), `--custom-item` (task type), and `--description-file` (SOP templates from a file). ClickUp API does not expose creation of custom fields or custom task types, both still require one-time UI setup, documented in the README. Driver: Seraph Immo workspace build (ramzi).
- 2026-04-20: feat(cli): `comments update <commentId> --text <text> [--resolved]` and `comments delete <commentId>`. `comments list` now prints `[commentId]` alongside the author so you can actually feed IDs to update/delete without leaving the CLI. Added because a stale comment I posted could not be retracted from the terminal. v0.4.0 (ramzi).
- 2026-04-20: feat(cli): `task get --fields` renders custom fields with dropdown option resolution (drop_down, labels, date, users, tasks, JSON fallback). Added to support post-Make-push QC: you need to eyeball a downstream task's custom fields from the terminal before declaring a scenario edit done. v0.3.0 (ramzi).
- 2026-04-13: feat(cli): migrate from commander to @heyramzi/cli SDK, consolidate 15 command files into single createCLI entry (ramzi)
- 2026-04-13: feat(cli): add docs scan command for workspace-wide call page discovery (ramzi)
- 2026-04-13: feat(cli): multi-token auth with priority-ordered fallback (ramzi)
- 2026-04-14: fix(cli): token fallback now triggers on ClickUp 404/ACCESS_999 — ClickUp returns 404 with ECODE ACCESS_999 for permission-denied responses, not 401/403; isAccessError now checks message for this code (ramzi)
- 2026-04-17: fix(cli): point @heyramzi/cli to CLIs/climaker (modules/cli path was broken); use getEnvVarOptional from climaker for CU_API_TOKEN and CU_TEAM_ID env resolution (ramzi)
- 2026-04-17: feat(types): add ClickUpPageAvatar with color/source fields, ClickUpTaskDocRelationship and response type from v3 OpenAPI spec (ramzi)
